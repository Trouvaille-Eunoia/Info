1. Shanmugasundaram M - PGP in Data Science and Business Analytics at The University of Texas at Austin - Red McCombs School of Business April 30, 2021, Shanmugasundaram was RR’S teacher 

RR is one of the best students I have come across in my 25 years of teaching experience. She is one of the hard working, highly inquisitive and brilliant students, who leaves no stone unturned in achieving her curricular and co-curricular goals with undying zest and overflowing zeal.
She had been a role model to her peers as well as juniors and has shown excellent oral and written communication skills during her class interactions. I had an opportunity to teach as well as mentor her during her final year project. Her perseverance, willingness to go extramiles to exceed the mentor expectations have always surprised me. She has extraordinary acumen to apply the learnt skills in converting them into innovative products of social relevance.
I wish her grand success in all her personal and professional endeavours 🎉 may God bless her always in all ways 🎉🎉🎉
